Since last few weeks the water leakage is being monitored.  It has been observed that there is repeated leakage from flat no 101, 102 and 307. <br> 2. Though fines have been imposed and collected, the situation is not improving, this is a matter of great concern for everyone. <br> 3. The water leakage is to be resolved amicably. Most of the defaulters are tenants. The flat owners need to solve the issue of overflowing tanks. <br> 4. The immediate action proposed is to immediately ask the tenants and their flat owners to rectify the defective floats, valves, etc. to stop the wastage of water. <br> 5. If this is not rectified or repaired, the next step will be to immediately cut off the inlet to Tank of the flats. As a result, these flats will get water only when there is water supply. In other words, they will not be able to store water in the tanks installed in their flats. <br> 6. The next action will be to ask flat owners/ tenants to get their tank overflow out let’s be made outside instead of their bathrooms. <br> 7. Incase this is not done, then this shall be got done by the builder/ society. <br> 8. The watchman have been directed to check the water level in the underground and overhead tanks before starting the water supply. In case the level is low, this should be brought to the notice of active members. <br> 9. The evening water supply shall be subjected to the availability of enough quantity of water. <br> 10. The minutes of meeting after finalization shall be printed and circulated to all residents and this shall be duly acknowledged by the Residents/ Tenants. The receipt of the MoM shall be taken as the points have been read, understood and agreed upon by the members. <br> 11.
